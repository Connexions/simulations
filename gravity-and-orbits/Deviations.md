# Deviations from the original PhET simulation **_and the reasons for them_**

Note that I do not list nominal changes like cosmetic differences (e.g., changing the color of the ground).

1. **Showing moon mass slider in "sun, planet, moon" scenario:**

    The only scenario where one of the bodies' mass cannot be changed is the "sun, planet, moon" simulation, where there are three bodies at play.  All the other ones have only two.  The reason why they did this is obvious--that there was limited space on the side panel, and it was more work than it was worth to fit a mass slider for the moon.  Since we don't have the same space constraints the way it's designed now, and it would be more work to write the one-off code to leave the moon out in this scenario than to let it be, I'm going to show the mass slider for the moon.
