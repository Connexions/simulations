PhET Documentation
===========

This simulation came with thorough documentation.  While our code must necessarily stray from their original structure at points, it is helpful to include these documents, as they outline and explain the intended structure and hierarchy and inner-workings of the simulation quite well.  I've included a version of the original Physics_Implementation.rtf converted into markdown for easy viewing on GitHub.
