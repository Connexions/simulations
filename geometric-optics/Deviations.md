# Deviations from the original PhET simulation **_and the reasons for them_**

Note that I do not list nominal changes like cosmetic differences (e.g., changing the color of the ground).

1. **Images that are not symmetrical along the vertical axis:**

    The reason why the makers of the original sim chose images that were symmetrical along across the vertical axis was probably so that they could just rotate an image 180 degrees and be scientifically accurate.  I realized my mistake in creating the graphics after I started using them and saw that the transformation happening on the screen didn't model the real world.  A lens not only flips the image vertically (because what is vertical really?) but also flips the image horizontally&mdash;or mirrors it across the center point of the lens in every direction.  In order to show the users the true nature of a lens and because it is not much extra work, I'm creating two versions of each image.
