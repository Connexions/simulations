# Deviations from the original PhET simulation **_and the reasons for them_**

Note that I do not list nominal changes like cosmetic differences (e.g., changing the color of the ground).

1. **Energy Diagram for Schr√∂dinger model doesn't show m=[value]:**

    There wasn't much space for it--and in fact it was rather awkward in the original.  It's not really necessary anyway because (n,l,m) = (value, value, value) is already displayed in the space box area.
