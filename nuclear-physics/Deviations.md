# Deviations from the original PhET simulation **_and the reasons for them_**

Note that I do not list nominal changes like cosmetic differences (e.g., changing the color of the ground).

1. **Simplification of isotope-symbol colors:**

    In the original sim, the various isotopes symbols were drawn in several colors--a unique color for each isotope.  Some of the colors were difficult to see and clashed with the overall theme.  I decided to simplify the color scheme so that all radioactive isotopes are one color and all decayed isotopes are another.  Because we don't have more than two isotopes in the scene at the same time (except in the case of the three Uranium isotopes), the only real information we need to convey through color is that a nucleus has decayed.  I think, therefore, that this change will bring more consistency as well as solve the problem of clashing colors, so I think it's a safe bet.
